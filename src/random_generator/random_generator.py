    This function will generate a random circuit by randomly selecting gates
    from the set of standard gates in :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates`. For example:

       :include-source:

       from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

       circ = random_circuit(2, 2, measure=True)
       circ.draw(output='mpl')

    Args:
        num_qubits (int): number of quantum wires
        depth (int): layers of operations (i.e. critical path length)
        max_operands (int): maximum qubit operands of each gate (between 1 and 4)
        measure (bool): if True, measure all qubits at the end
        conditional (bool): if True, insert middle measurements and conditionals
        reset (bool): if True, insert middle resets
        seed (int): sets random seed (optional)

    Returns:
        QuantumCircuit: constructed circuit
